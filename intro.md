## What is TypeScript?

At its core, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript. TypeScript introduces static typing, which allows you to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This additional layer of type information helps catch errors during development, making your code more reliable.

## Benefits of TypeScript

1. Static Typing: TypeScript catches type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime, reducing the chances of unexpected issues in your code.
2. Enhanced Tooling: TypeScript provides excellent tooling support through code editors like Visual Studio Code, helping you write code faster and with fewer mistakes.
3. Readability: Type annotations make your code self-documenting, making it easier for you and other developers to understand and maintain.
4. Community and Adoption: TypeScript is widely adopted in the industry, and it has a growing and active community, which means more resources and support for developers.
